# 5‑Nines Radio – 5G Testbed

**5‑Nines Radio** is a high‑reliability 5G testbed platform designed to evaluate
ultra‑reliable low‑latency communication (URLLC) scenarios.


## Why the name Five-Nines Radio?

“Five-Nines Radio” refers to a 5G radio communication system designed to achieve a high level of reliability and availability, often measured as “five nines" or 99.999% uptime. The main objective is to engineer the radio system to maintain connectivity and communication capabilities with minimal downtime, ensuring reliable operation even in challenging environments or during adverse conditions.

## Five-Nines Radio Architecture

There are two operating modes of Five-Nines Radio:

- Five-Nines Radio – 5G Non-Stand Alone (NSA) mode
- Five-Nines Radio – 5G Stand Alone (SA) mode

In NSA mode, to establish a connection with a 5G Smartphone, one requires a 4G base station (i.e. eNB), a 5G base station (i.e. gNB), and a 4G core network (CN), i.e. evolved packet core (EPC). All control-plane traffic is handled by the eNB whereas the user-plane traffic is handled by the gNB.

In SA mode, both the control-plane and user-plane traffic are handled by the gNB and 5G core network.
