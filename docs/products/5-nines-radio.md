# 5‑Nines Radio – 5G Testbed

!!! info "Why the name Five‑Nines Radio?"
    **Five‑Nines Radio** refers to a 5G radio communication system designed
    to achieve a high level of reliability and availability, often measured
    as **“five nines” (99.999% uptime)**. The main objective is to engineer the radio system to maintain
    connectivity and communication capabilities with **minimal downtime**,
    ensuring reliable operation even in **challenging environments or
    adverse conditions**.


**5‑Nines Radio** is a high‑reliability 5G testbed platform designed to evaluate
ultra‑reliable low‑latency communication (URLLC) scenarios.




<h2 class="features">Five-Nines Radio Architecture</h2> There are two operating modes of Five-Nines Radio:

- Five-Nines Radio – 5G Non-Stand Alone (NSA) mode
- Five-Nines Radio – 5G Stand Alone (SA) mode

In NSA mode, to establish a connection with a 5G Smartphone, one requires a 4G base station (i.e. eNB), a 5G base station (i.e. gNB), and a 4G core network (CN), i.e. evolved packet core (EPC). All control-plane traffic is handled by the eNB whereas the user-plane traffic is handled by the gNB. In SA mode, both the control-plane and user-plane traffic are handled by the gNB and 5G core network.
