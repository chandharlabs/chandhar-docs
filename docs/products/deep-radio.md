## Features

### RF Signal Classification using Deep Radio

Deep Radio is capable of classifying 12 different modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16 PSK, 32 PSK, GMSK, 16 QAM, GFSK, CPFSK, OOK) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with high accuracy.

### Dynamic Spectrum Access using Deep Radio

Deep Radio is capable of sensing the RF spectrum in the range 100 MHz to 6 GHz. Thus, it can be used as a Cognitive Radio system by opportunistically identifying unused frequency bands.

### Integration with CRFO

Deep Radio is integrated with Collaborative Radio Frequency Observatory (CRFO, https://map.crfo.org.in) to enable collaborative research and development in the field of wireless communication in a cost-effective manner.

### Python Programming

Deep Radio uses Python programming language due to its data handling capabilities, ease availability of code libraries for machine learning applications, capabilities to interact with other third party languages and platforms.
