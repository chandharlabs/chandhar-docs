## Abstract

“LTE Hands‑On” is a comprehensive laboratory manual designed to provide
undergraduate and postgraduate students with a practical understanding
of 4G LTE systems.

The book bridges theory and practice through step‑by‑step experiments
covering the core aspects of LTE networks — from user equipment
registration and PDN connectivity to advanced topics such as
channel quality indicators, link adaptation, and network planning.

It emphasizes experiential learning using software‑defined radio (SDR)
platforms and open‑source LTE implementations. Students gain exposure to
control‑plane and user‑plane traffic flows in the Evolved Packet Core (EPC),
visualization of LTE time–frequency domain signals, and live transmission
of OFDM signals.

The book also provides in‑depth analysis of PSS, SSS, PBCH, cell reference
signals, and FFT‑based frequency‑domain studies, enabling a strong
understanding of LTE’s OFDM architecture.

By incorporating network design and path‑loss analysis across standard
propagation environments (UMi, UMa, SMa, RMa), the book equips learners with
a holistic view of LTE performance under real‑world conditions.
