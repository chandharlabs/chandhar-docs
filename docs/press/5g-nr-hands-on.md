## Abstract

**“5G NR Hands‑On”** is a comprehensive laboratory manual designed to provide
practical, end‑to‑end insights into **5G Standalone (SA) and Non‑Standalone (NSA)**
mobile networks.

Aligned with industry deployments and academic research needs, the book
enables learners to analyze the complete **5G protocol stack** — from UE
registration and PDU session establishment to traffic flow analysis using
**5G Service‑Based Architecture (SBA)** with PCAP and REST APIs.

The book covers **PHY, MAC, RLC, SDAP, PFCP, NGAP, and RRC procedures**, including
DU–CU functional split architecture, PRACH analysis, MIMO channel modeling,
link adaptation, TDD slot configuration, and performance evaluation.

It extends to real‑world integrations such as **network slicing, IoT using MQTT,
Raspberry Pi interfacing with 5G modems**, REST‑API‑based core interaction,
and machine‑type communications.

By combining waveform generation, air‑interface characterization,
protocol tracing, and benchmarking for **SISO and 2×2 MIMO**, the book
provides full‑spectrum practical exposure for universities, R&D labs,
and industry training programs.
